## Flight Fare Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
> This project aims to predict flight fares using a machine learning model called Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.

### Prerequisites
- To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following:
    - Python 3
    - Jupyter Notebook
    -  Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, flask
- You can install the required libraries using pip <br>
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/CaptaiN785/Flight-Fare-Prediction.git`
   
2. Change to the project directory:<br>
   `cd Flight-Fare-Prediction`

3. Run the Flask app on localhost:<br>
   `python app.py`
